        <code>Zend_Measure</code> provides a generic and very easy way for working with measurements.
    </para>
    <para>
        Using <code>Zend_Measure</code>, you can convert measurements into different units of the same type.
        They can be added, subtracted and compared against each other.
        From a given input made in the user's native language, the unit of measurement can be automatically extracted.
    </para>
    <para>
        Of course a great number of completely different units of measurement is being supported. Most
        of these units are of a physical nature, but there are also special measurements used, in numerics or
        other areas, that are only partly physical - or not at all.
    </para>
    <para>
        The following quickstart tutorial shows how units of measurement can be automatically converted.
    </para>
    <example>
        <title>Converting measurements</title>
        <para>
            To convert a measurement, its value and its type have to be known.
            The value can be an integer, a float, or even a string.
        </para>
        <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
require_once 'Zend/Measure.php';

// The Length class is needed when using the constants
require_once 'Zend/Measure/Length.php';

$unit = new Zend_Measure(100,Zend_Measure_Length::METER,'en');

// Convert meters to yards
echo $unit->convertTo(Zend_Measure_Length::YARD);
?>]]></programlisting>
        <para>
            <note>
                As you can see, the example consists of only 4 lines of code.
                The usage of <code>Zend_Measure</code> is so compact that usually 4 lines of code is all that's needed.
