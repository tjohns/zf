        With web applications written using PHP, a <emphasis role="bold">session</emphasis> represents a logical,
        one-to-one connection between server-side, persistent state data and a particular user agent client (e.g. web
        browser). Zend_Session helps manage and preserve session data, a logical complement of cookie data, across
        multiple page requests by the same client. Unlike cookie data, session data is not stored on the client side,
        and it is only shared with the client when server-side source code makes the data available via a response to a
        request from the client. For the purposes of this component and documentation, session data refers to the
        server-side data managed by Zend_Session.

        The Zend_Session component wraps the existing PHP ext/session to provide a standardized, object-oriented
        interface for working with sessions, including both anonymous and login sessions. Zend_Auth, the authentication
        component of the ZF uses Zend_Session to store some information associated with login sessions. Since
        Zend_Session uses the normal PHP session functions internally, all the usual configuration options and settings
        apply (see
        <ulink
      url="http://www.php.net/session">http://www.php.net/session</ulink>
        ). Thus, a session id, stored either in a cookie or URLs, maintains the association between a client and session
        state data.

        The default

      save handler</ulink>
        does not solve the problem of maintaining this association, when a client may connect to any sever in a cluster
        of servers, since session state data is saved to the local server only. A list of appropriate save handlers will
        be provided, when available.
