    <title>Using Translation Adapters</title>

    <para>
        The next step is to use the adapter within your code.
    </para>

    </example>    

    <para>
        The example above shows some output with no support for translation.
        You probably write your code in your native language.
        Generally you need to translate translate not only the output,
        but also error messages and log messages.
    </para>

    <para>
        The next step is to include Zend Translate in your existing code.
        Of course it is much easier if you are writing your code using
        Zend_Translate instead of changing your code afterwards.
    </para>

    <example id="zend.translate.using.example2">
        <title>Example of multi-lingual PHP code</title>
        <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
require_once("Zend/Translate.php");

$translate = new Zend_Translate('gettext', '/my/path/source-de.mo', 'de');
$translate->addTranslation('//my/path/fr-source.mo', 'fr');

print $translate->_("Example")."\n";
print "=======\n";
print $translate->_("Here is line one")."\n";
printf($translate->_("Today is the %1\$s") . "\n", date("d.m.Y"));
print "\n";

$translation->setLanguage('fr');
print $translate->_("Fix language here is line two") . "\n";
?>]]></programlisting>
    </example>    

    <para>
        Now let's get a deeper look into what has been done and how to
        integrate Zend_Translate into your code.
    </para>

    <para>
        Create a new Translation object and define the base adapter:

<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
require_once("Zend/Translate.php");

$translate = new Zend_Translate('gettext', '/my/path/source-de.mo', 'de');
?>]]></programlisting>

        In this example we decided the
        <emphasis role="strong">Gettext Adapter</emphasis>.
        We place our file <emphasis role="strong">source-de.mo</emphasis>
        into the directory <emphasis role="strong">/my/path</emphasis>.
        The gettext file will have German translation included.
        And we also added another language source for French.
    </para>

    <para>
        The next step is to wrap all strings which are to be translated.
        The simplest approach is to have only simple strings or sentences
        like this:

<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
print $translate->_("Example")."\n";
print "=======\n";
print $translate->_("Here is line one")."\n";
?>]]></programlisting>

        Some strings do not needed to be translated.
        The seperating line is always a seperating line,
        even in other languages.
    </para>

    <para>
        Having data values integrated into a translation string is also 
        supported through the use of embedded parameters.
        
<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
printf($translate->_("Today is the %1\$s") . "\n", date("d.m.Y"));
?>]]></programlisting>

        Instead of <code>print()</code>, use the <code>printf()</code>
        function and replace all parameters with <code>%1\$s</code> parts.
        The first is <code>%1\$s</code>, the second <code>%2\$s</code>,
        and so on. This way a translation can be done without knowing 
        the exact value. In our example, the date is always the actual day,
        but the string can be translated without the knowledge of the actual
        day.
    </para>

    <para>
        Each string is identified in the translation storage by a message id.
        You can use message id's instead of strings in your code, like this:

<programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[<?php
print $translate->_(1)."\n";
print "=======\n";
print $translate->_(2)."\n";
?>]]></programlisting>

        But doing this has several disadvantages:
    </para>

    <para>
        You can not see what your code should output just by viewing your code.
    </para>

    <para>
        Also you will get problems if some strings are not translated.
        You always must imagine how translation works.
        First Zend_Translate looks if the set language has a translation
        for the given message id or string.
        If no translation string has been found it refers to the next lower 
        language as defined within Zend_Locale.
        So "<emphasis role="strong">de_AT</emphasis>" becomes
        "<emphasis role="strong">de</emphasis>" only.
        If there is no translation found for
        "<emphasis role="strong">de</emphasis>" either,
        then the original message is returned.
        This way you always have an output, in case the message translation
        does not exist in your message storage.
        Zend_Translate never throws an error or exception when translating
        strings.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="zend.translate.using.structure">

        <title>Translation Source Structures</title>

        <para>
            Your next step is to create the translation sources for the several
            languages to which you translate.
            Every adapter is created its own way as described here.
            But there are some general features that are relevant for all adapters.

            You should know where to store your translation source files.
            With Zend_Translate you are not bound to any restriction.

            Gettext source files are created by GNU's gettext library.
            There are several free tools available that can parse your
            code files and create the needed gettext source files.
            These files have the ending <emphasis role="strong">*.mo</emphasis>

            As you can see the adapters are used exactly the same way,

            Change 'array' to 'gettext'.  All other usages are exactly
            the same as with all other adapters.
            With the gettext adapter you no longer have to be aware of
            gettext's standard directory structure,
            bindtextdomain and textdomain.
            Just give the path and filename to the adapter.

                 You should always use UTF-8 as source encoding.
                 Otherwise you will have problems if you are using two
                 different source encodings.
                 For example, if one of your source files is encoded
                 with ISO-8815-11 and another file is encoded with CP815.
                 You can set only one encoding for your source file,
                 so one of your languages probably will not display correctly.

            <para>
                 UTF-8 is a portable format which supports all languages.
