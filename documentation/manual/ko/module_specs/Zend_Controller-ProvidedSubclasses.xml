                parameters parsed from the URI. By proxying to

                access to values contained in the superglobals as public

                    When accessing superglobal data through <code>Zend_Controller_Request_Http</code>
                    as public member properties, it is necessary to keep in mind that

                    in a specific order of precedence: 1. GET, 2. POST, 3. COOKIE, 4. SERVER, 5. ENV.

                Specific superglobals can be accessed using a public method as an
                alternative. For example, the raw value of <code>$_POST['user']</code>
                can be accessed by calling <code>getPost('user')</code> on the
                request object.

                then be stripped from the beginning of the path before
                calculating any route matches. This frees one from the necessity
                of prepending it to any of your routes. A route of

                <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Rewrite</code> is the standard
                framework router. Routing is the process of taking a URI
                endpoint (that part of the URI which comes after the base URL)
                and decomposing it into parameters to determine which controller
                and action of that controller should receive the request. This
                value of the controller, action and other parameters is packaged
                into a <code>Zend_Controller_Request_Http</code> object which is
                then processed by <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard</code>.
                Routing occurs only once: when the request is initially received
                and before the first controller is dispatched.

                Routing is a simple process of iterating through all provided routes 
                and matching it's definitions to current request URI. When a positive match is found,

                object for later use in dispatcher as well as in user created controllers. On a negative match

                <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Route</code>
                constructor is a route definition that will be matched to a URL. 
                Route definition consists of static and dynamic parts 
                separated by the slash ('/') character. Dynamic parts, called variables,
                are marked by the colon prepended to the variable name  
                (eg. <code>:username</code>). Static parts are just a simple text (eg. <code>author</code>).

                    Current implementation allows you to use any
                    characters (except a slash) as a variable identifier but it is
                    strongly recommended that one uses only php variable friendly
                    characters. Implementation may be altered in the future which 
                    could result in hidden bugs in your code.

            <para>
                This example route should be matched when you point your browser to 
                <code>'http://domain.com/author/martel'</code> in which case all it's 
                variables will be injected to the <code>Zend_Controller_Request</code> object
                and will be accessible in your ProfileController. Variables returned by 
                this example may be represented as an array of following key

            <para>
                Later on <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher</code> should invoke userinfoAction 
                method of your ProfileController class (in default module) based on these 
                values. There you will be able to access all variables by the means of 
                Zend_Controller_Action::_getParam or Zend_Controller_Request::getParam methods:

                Route definition can contain one more special character - a wildcard - represented 
                by '*' symbol. It is used to gather parameters similarly to Module route (var => value 
                pairs defined in the URI). Following route mimicks Module route behavior:

                is used for. This parameter is an array with keys representing variable

                This example will result in injecting a year variable to the request object. 
                And since no routing information is present (no controller and
                action parameters are defined) application will be dispatched to default controller 
                and action method (which are both defined in <code>Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Abstract</code>). 
                To make it more usable you have to provide a valid controller and

            <para>
                The examples above all use dynamic routes -- routes that contain
                patterns to match against. Sometimes, however, a particular
                route is set in stone, and firing up the regular expression
                engine would be an overkill. The answer to this situation is to use
                static routes:
            </para>

            <programlisting role="php"><![CDATA[

            <para>
                In addition to the default and static route types, a Regular
                Expression route type is available. This route offers more power
                and flexibility over the others, but at a slight cost of
                complexity. And should be faster than a standard Route at the same time.
            </para>

            <para>
                As well as the standard route, this route has to be initialized with 
                route definition and some defaults. Let's create an archive route as 
                an example, similar to the previoulsy defined one, only using Regex 
                route this time:

                Every defined regex subpattern will be injected

                <code>http://domain.com/archive/2006</code>, the resulting value array 
                may look like:

                    Leading and trailing slashes are trimmed from the URL in the Router 
                    prior to a match. As a result, matching the URL <code>http://domain.com/foo/bar/</code>,
                    would involve a regex of <code>foo/bar</code>.

                    Line start and line end anchors ('^' and '$', respectively)
                    are automatically pre- and appended to all expressions.
                    Thus, you should not use these in your regular expressions.

                <para>
                    This route class uses the <code>#</code> character for a delimiter. This
                    means that you will need to escape hash characters ('#') in your route definitions.
                    But since these characters aren't passed to the webserver (named anchors), 
                    you will rarely need to do so.

                This route will not yet work exactly the same as it's standard route counterpart since
                the default for 'year' is not yet set. And what may not yet be evident we will 
                have a problem with a trailing slash even if we declare default for the year 
                and make the subpattern optional. The solution is to make the whole year part optional 
                along with the slash but catch only the numeric part:

                Now let's get to the problem you have probably noticed on your

                an easily manageable solution and may be potentially problematic 
                in the long run. And that's where the third parameter comes in. One which

                The above INI file can then be read into a

            <para>
                In the above example, we tell the router to use the 'routes'
                section of the INI file to use for its routes. Each first-level
                key under that section will be used to define a route name; the
                above example defines the routes 'archive' and 'news'. Each
                route then requires, minimally a 'route' entry and one or more
                'defaults' entries; optionally one or more 'reqs' (short for
                'required') may be provided. All told, these correspond to the
                three arguments provided to a <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Interface</code>
                object. An option key, 'type', can be used to specify the route
                class type to use for that particular route; by default, it uses
                <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Route</code>. In the example above,
                the 'news' route is defined to use
                <code>Zend_Controller_Router_Route_Static</code>.

        <para>
            <code>Zend_Controller_Response_Http</code> is a response object
            suitable for use in an HTTP environment. It contains methods for
            setting, retrieving, and clearing headers, and the
            <code>__toString()</code> method sends all headers at once before
            returning the response content.

        <para>
            <code>setHeader()</code> takes two arguments, a header type and the
            header value. A third, optional parameter, if passed and true, will
            force the new header to replace any other headers registered with
            that type.

            <code>Zend_Controller_Response_Cli</code> is a response object
            suitable for use in an CLI environment. It has no methods for
            handling headers, and simply returns all body content when
            <code>__toString()</code> is invoked.
