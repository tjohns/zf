        As of version 1.7, Zend Framework integrates <ulink
            url="http://jquery.com">jQuery</ulink> view and form helpers through
        its extras library. The jQuery support is meant as an alternative
         to the already existing Dojo library integration. Currently jQuery can
         be integrated into your Zend Framework applications in the following ways:

        By default the jQuery javascript dependencies are loaded from the Google Ajax Library
        Content Distribution Network. The CDN offers both jQuery Core and jQuery UI access points and
        the view helpers therefore can already offer you most the dependencies out of the box. Currently
        the Google CDN offers jQuery UI support up to version 1.5.2, but the jQuery view and form helpers
        already make use of the UI library 1.6 version (AutoComplete, ColorPicker, Spinner, Slider).
        To make use of these great additions you have to download the release candidate version of the
        <ulink url="http://ui.jquery.com">jQuery UI library</ulink> from its website.
