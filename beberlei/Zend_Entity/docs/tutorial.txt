Zend Entity
===================

Zend Entity is an object-relational mapper that centers around the concept of Domain Driven Design and Entity objects.
An entity object is one that has identity across different requests in your application and can be identified by
its unique identity. In contrast value objects are only represented by their values, which can change, such as a
<code>DateTime</code> or a Money object.

Although the identity closely resembles to the primary key concept in relational databases, Zend_Entity aims at
defining entities that are not coupled to database tables, but are independent of relational databases. Think
of building your domain layer with objects without thinking about how to fit them to the database and when persistence
is finally an issue, Zend Entity allows to persist your object graph into a database and re-instantiate it from there.

Defining an Entity
--------------------

As stated before, just go about writing the objects that define your domain model, we think about persistence later.
This documentation will use a consistent example of the ElePHPhant Railways Coorparation (ERC), which wants to implement
a system to represent their railways operation that sells tickets to train routes to their customers. This topic
is rather complex for a documentation example, but we will implement it by requirement and update each implementation
accordingly. We begin with the "Route". Currently the ERC does not have stopovers between its origin and destination,
such that a the implementation of a Route might look like:

    class Route {
        /**
         * @var int
         */
        private $routeId;

        /**
         * @var Station
         */
        private $originStation;

        /**
         * @var int
         */
        private $originDepartureDate;

        /**
         * @var Station
         */
        private $destinationStation;

        /**
         * @var int
         */
        private $destinationArrivalDate;
    }

    class Station {
        /**
         * @var int
         */
        private $stationId;

        /**
         * @var string
         */
        private $stationName;
    }

We would have to add get and set methods to access these properties, but in general this datastructure defines
the business we are in currently. How do we persist this representation? Zend Entity defines metadata for each
entity object that describe how the object structure should be persisted into a database.

Introduction to Persistence Metadata: Routes and Stations
----------------------------

By default metadata are of entities are described using a programmatic PHP description language. These are called
Resources and can generally be described by YAML, XML or even Annotations as long as they can translate into the
generic object notation. To describe the <code>Route</code> and <code>Station</code> classes we create two new
files Route.php and Station.php and put them into a "config/definitions/railways" folder somewhere into the application.

Route.php

    $def = new Zend_Db_Mapper_Definition_Entity("Route", array("table" => "routes"));
    $def->addPrimaryKey("routeId", array(
        'columnName' => 'id',
    ));
    $def->addProperty("originDepartureDate", array('columnName' => 'origin_departure_date'));
    $def->addProperty("destinationArrivalDate", array('columnName' => 'destination_arrival_date'));

    $def->addManyToOneRelation("originStation", array(
        'class' => 'Station',
        'columnName' => 'origin_station_id'
    ));
    $def->addManyToOneRelation("destinationStation", array(
        'class' => 'Station',
        'columnName' => 'destination_station_id'
    ));

    return $def;

Station.php

    $def = new Zend_Db_Mapper_Definition_Entity("Station", array("table" => "stations"));
    $def->addPrimaryKey("stationId", array("columnName" => "id"));
    $def->addProperty("stationName", array('columnName' => 'station_name'));

    $def->addCollection("startingRoutes", array(
        'relation' => new Zend_Db_Mapper_Definition_OneToManyRelation(
            'origin_station_id',
            array(
                'class' => 'Route',

            )
         ),
         'key' => 'origin_station_id',
    ));

    return $def;

Many defaults are assumed in this example on how the two entities relate to each other. The description
of the entities is quite expressive and by starring just a little on the code examples one can guess what is going
on behind the scenes.

This metadata requires the following SQL statements (MySQL dialect) to communicate successfully with the database:

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `routes` (
      `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
      `origin_station_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
      `origin_departure_date` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
      `destination_station_id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
      `destination_arrival_date` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
      KEY `origin_station_id` (`origin_station_id`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `stations` (
      `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
      `station_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
      PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
    ) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 AUTO_INCREMENT=1 ;

Now the only thing that is missing is the extension of <code>Route</code> and <code>Station</code> with a generic
interface that is required to make the entities reveal their state to the EntityManager Persistence Context:

    class Route implements Zend_Entity_Interface {
        // ...

        public function setState(array $state)
        {
            foreach($state AS $k => $v) {
                $this->$k = $v;
            }
        }

        public function getState()
        {
            return array(
                'routeId' => $this->routeId,
                'originStationId' => $this->originStationId,
                'originDepartureDate' => $this->originDepartureDate,
                'destinationStationId' => $this->destinationStationId,
                'destinationArrivalDate' => $this->destinationArrivalDate,
            );
        }
    }

    class Station implements Zend_Entity_Interface {
        // ..

        public function getState()
        {
            return array(
                'stationId' => $this->stationId,
                'stationName' => $this->stationName,
            );
        }

        public function setState(array $state)
        {
            foreach($state AS $k => $v) {
                $this->$k = $v;
            }
        }
    }

Creating the EntityManager Persistence Context
---------------------

Zend Entity has a simple API offered via a facade of the <code>Zend_Entity_Manager_Interface type</code>. To create a new
persistence context session the only required dependencies are a <code>Zend_Db_Adapter_Abstract</code> and a
Resource map that points to the metadata definitions of the entities.

    $db = Zend_Db::factory("pdo_mysql", $options);

    $resource = new Zend_Entity_Resource_Code("config/definitions/railways/");
    $manager = new Zend_Entity_Manager($db, array('resource' => $resource));

Now we can add some data to the database by creating new entities and saving them into persistence context:

    $stationBerlin = new Station();
    $stationBerlin->setName('Berlin Hbf');
    $manager->save($stationBerlin);

    $stationBonn = new Station();
    $stationBonn->setName('Bonn Hbf');
    $manager->save($stationBonn);

    $route = new Route();
    $route->setOriginStation($stationBerlin);
    $route->setOriginDepartureDate(new datetime());
    $route->setDestinationStation($stationBonn);
    $route->setDestinationArrivalDate(new datetime());
    $manager->save($route);

Accessing the newly saved data is possible through several API methods of the entity manager:

    $manager->findByKey('Route', 1);
    $manager->findByKey('Station', 1);
    $manager->findAll('Route', $whereCond, $order, $limit); // much as Zend_Db_Table::findAll

    $select = $manager->select('Route');
    $manager->find('Route', $select);
    $manager->findOne('Route', $select);
