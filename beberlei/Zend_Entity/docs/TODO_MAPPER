TODO

* Type Casting: Test it
* Rename Resource into MetadataFactory
* Implement support for Custom Collection Classes
* UnitOfWork: Topographical Sorting? Implement user-land overridable
* Definitions: Inverse Relationsships
* Definitions: Initializing of Loader and Persister and fetching of relations should be done lazy
* Definitions: Add compound keys through a PrimaryKey object.
* Definitions: Entity - Add Namespace argument for entities to write less on Subnamespaced entities when referencing them.
* Definitions: Add Entity-Name Configuration Option
* Collections: Add difference between Set, Map and List ?! May even add Ordered Lists via callback or own implementation
* Collections: Lazy Load Collection should allow to add elements without triggering the lazy load and having them integrated correctly, when lazy load is triggered.
* Lazy Load Entities: Class has to be overwritable to implement the Entity interface that fakes identity.
* Mapper: Save and Delete
    * Implement Cascading Persisters
* Manager/Mapper: Add reference to entity in Zend_Entity_Db_Select to save one call to entity name.
* Mapper: refresh() method needs specific API method on the loader to be useful
* Loader: Implement Field lazy loading, maybe supporting contextual lazyloading of more than one field like in http://datamapper.org/doku.php?id=spotlight:laziness
* EntityManager: Implement Second Level Cache into IdentityMap - Zend_Cache holds objects in Cache for a lifetime, re-cached on each change
    * Easy: Cachable are only the Database representations of an object, not the object itsself. This way all the objects are saved on their own
    * Dependency: Implement Registry or Factory for EntityManager, allowing to serialize/deserialize Lazy Load collections corretcly
    * Hold Entities Per Id
    * Hold Collections Per Select Statement (invalidate this more often)

Workable Tests:
* Self referencing objects
* Association table loading
