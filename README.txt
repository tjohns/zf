INTENDED USE
------------

The code in this release provides a 'sneak peek' at features to be released in the
upcoming Zend Framework 1.7 release and is not intended for production use. Please be
aware that the API's introduced in this release may not be final, and that the Zend
Framework team does not guarantee backwards compatibility to this release in future
releases of Zend Framework. We strongly discourage the use of this preview
release in production environments or for projects that could not easily be
refactored to work with future releases of Zend Framework. We recommend
evaluating these features for use in future projects, however, and would appreciate
any feedback.
